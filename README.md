# Kernel_for_multithreaded_operating_system

### General Info
Kernel implementation for multithreaded operating system. Configuration is similar to embedded systems configuration where kernel and user application share the same address space and represent one program which is in advance loaded in working memory. Kernel is implemented for RISC V architecture.

### Implemented concepts
A list of concepts implemented within the project:
* Memory allocator
* Threads
* Semaphores
* Time sharing
* Synchronized and asynchronized context switch
* I/O operations
* Kernel interfaces (ABI, C API, C++ API)
